## 🧩 Key Components
- **MA-CCT Architecture**: 
  - Replaces MHSA in Transformer with causal-convolution based token-mixer
  - Better captures localized temporal patterns in MDP sequences
  - Enhanced generalization for OOD states through improved Markov property modeling
- **CurExp Mechanism**: 
  - Utilizes forward dynamics model for next-state transition prediction
  - Uses prediction error to guide exploration towards uncertain states
  - Bridges offline-online distribution gap during fine-tuning
- **MSAL Scheduler**: 
  - Multi-stage adaptive learning rate adjustment
  - Warmup phase for stability, exploration phase for adaptation, fine-tuning phase for convergence
  - Dynamic optimization based on real-time performance feedback
